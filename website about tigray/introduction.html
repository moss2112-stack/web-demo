    <div class="content">
        <div class="parrag">
            <p>Tigray, located in northern Ethiopia, 
			is a region rich in history, culture, and natural beauty. 
			As the northernmost regional state, it shares borders with Eritrea to the north, 
			Sudan to the west, and the Ethiopian regions of Amhara and Afar to the south and east, respectively.
			The region's terrain is predominantly mountainous, with elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,300 meters.
			This topography has historically provided natural defenses against invasions and has contributed to Tigray's distinct cultural and historical
			identity. Tigray is renowned as the cradle of Ethiopian civilization, being home to the ancient city of Aksum. Aksum was the center of
			the Aksumite Empire, one of the great civilizations of the ancient world, known for its impressive obelisks, royal tombs,
			and as a hub of early Christianity.</p>

       <h2>LIVING CONDITIONS</h2>
       <p>
        There are still few Western-trained physicians and life expectancy is low in Tigray. 
        An increase in government clinics has not eliminated this problem. Chronic, parasitic diseases, 
        such as malaria and schistosomiasis, are a problem in some regions. Many children die from communicable diseases such as measles and chicken pox. 
        However, heart disease and lung cancer are rare, and people in their 50s are at the peak of their careers. By age 70 most people have retired from
        active farming.
        </p>
        <p>
        In rural areas, the main prestige items purchased are mules, often as status symbols for display to people outside the community. 
        Generally speaking, status symbols have little importance. Within a community, people know one another well, and only deeds can add to a 
        person's reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
        A Tigray house provides shelter and contributes to the occupant's reputation in the community. A young couple's first house is usually a gujji, 
        a practical, unimpressive house that the couple builds for itself. A gujji is a hut of wattle and daub—rods interwoven with twigs or branches—with a 
        thatched roof. If the couple is successful, their next house will be more elaborate, with masonry walls and domed roofs supported by 
        heavy wooden beams. Increasingly, houses are roofed with sheet metal. A very powerful family may later add stone walls around the yard.
        </p>
        <p>
        Guests often bring stones with them as gifts of respect, to be added to the walls. One may view the walls as a concrete demonstration 
        of one's friends' esteem.
        </p>
    <p>
        Even the most elaborate rural houses have neither electricity nor running water. Candles or oil lamps provide light in the evening. 
        The masonry walls and domed roofs provide good insulation and are comfortable in both cold and hot seasons. Fires for cooking and heating 
        are fueled by wood or dried cow dung.
    </p>
    <p>
        An average household in a farming community produces and consumes goods valued in hundreds of dollars per year; even small purchases
        by Western standards, such as soft drinks, represent substantial expenditures for rural Tigray.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trucks and buses provide nearly all the road transportation, but many places people wish to go are not accessible by roads. 
        Thus, many people travel by foot and carry loads on donkeys, mules, and camels. 
        (Camels and mules also carry salt tablets from salt beds below sea level 
        in the Danakil depression up to the 8,000 ft plateaus of Tigray, where they are loaded onto trucks for transport to other parts of Ethiopia.)
